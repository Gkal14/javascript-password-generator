# javascript-password-generator
For this project I needed to modify code to create a working random password generator for users which satisfied certain criteria.

Actions performed on this project:
- Understand the criteria and set the arrays using Javascript
- Create appropriate prompts and alerts when criteria have or have not been met.
- Troubleshooting was a big task on this projects as I could not always identify the issue by simply running a console.log
- Apply appropriate math tools to generate the passwords once the parameters had been set by the user.
- Ensure that the password displays on the screen without any errors.

Below you will find a screenshot and a link to the deployed application.
